# 🌱 IoT-Enabled Vertical Hydroponics System

An intelligent, automated, and remotely managed hydroponic farming solution designed for urban agriculture.

## 🔧 Overview

This project implements a **vertical hydroponics system** powered by **IoT technology** to optimize plant growth in a sustainable and space-efficient manner. It leverages an **ESP32 microcontroller** to manage environmental conditions and automate nutrient delivery.

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 **ESP32-Based Control**  
  Acts as the brain of the system, managing sensors and actuators.

- 💧 **Water Pump Automation**  
  Controlled via a **relay module** to deliver precise water and nutrient supply.

- 🌡️ **Environmental Monitoring**  
  - **DHT22 Sensor** monitors real-time **temperature** and **humidity**  
  - **TDS Sensor** checks the **nutrient concentration** in water

- 📲 **Remote Monitoring with Blynk 2.0**  
  Real-time sensor data and control interface through the **Blynk IoT dashboard** for mobile and web.

- 🌍 **Smart Urban Farming**  
  A scalable, efficient solution for growing fresh produce in urban settings with minimal resources.

## 🌿 Benefits

- Optimized resource usage (water, nutrients)  
- Easy remote access and automation  
- Supports sustainable, soil-less agriculture  
- Ideal for smart city and home farming setups
