This project is an IoT-enabled vertical hydroponics system designed to automate and optimize plant growth using modern technology. The system is built around an ESP32 controller, which manages various components to ensure optimal growing conditions. A relay module is used to control the water pump, ensuring that the plants receive the right amount of nutrients and water. The DHT22 sensor monitors temperature and humidity levels, while the TDS sensor measures the nutrient concentration in the water. All data is integrated and monitored in real-time using Blynk 2.0, allowing for remote management and automation. This project showcases the integration of IoT in agriculture, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for urban farming.
